DESCRIPTION:  Unveiled on June 20, 2024, Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic marks a monumental leap in AI, setting new benchmarks across cognitive tasks with the introduction of three model families‚ÄîHaiku, Sonnet, and Opus‚Äîeach designed to balance intelligence, speed, and cost-efficiency for a range of applications.

Nevertheless, its capabilities rival GPT-4, positioning it among the world's top AI models.
